h1. LAML (Luke And Ali Markup Language)

This is a lightweight, in-progress, layout, component and application framework for ActionScript 3 SWF applications.

There are many similarities between this framework and Flex, but following are some of the differences:

* Supports (and was created using) Test-Driven Development
* Avoids Singletons and custom compilation units (like extra frames and pre-loaders)
* Tiny download footprint
* Minimize duplicate boilerplate code
* Supports workflow and views built using Flash Authoring
* Simple creation of skins and themes
* Supports both compile time and run time XML layout documents
* Composite component structure does not extend DisplayObject
* Supports simple separation of an application into multiple SWF files
* Applications and components can be developed identically
