h1. LAML (Luke And Ali Markup Language)

This is a lightweight, in-progress layout and component framework for ActionScript 3 development. 

There are many similarities between this framework and Flex, but there are some significant differences.

* Supports (and was created using) Test-Driven Development
* Avoids Singletons and custom compilation units (like extra frames and pre-loaders)
* Tiny download footprint
* Minimize duplicate boilerplate code
* Supports workflow and views built using Flash Authoring
* Simple creation of skins and themes
* Supports both compile time and run time XML layout (configuration) documents
* Composite component structure does not extend DisplayObject

This is not intended to be a replacement for the Flex framework. Flex meets a different set of needs.

This code is intended to stay light and fast. It should remain asily comprehensible and provide just enough functionality to get the job done quickly, and correctly.
